<h1>Dog Walking</h1>
<hr>

<p>A regular walk is vitally important for your pet's health too. Obesity in pets is associated with a number of medical complaints including osteoarthritis, cardiovascular disease, liver disease and insulin resistance.

Most dogs need to be walked at least once each day, though some dogs, particularly very active dogs, may require more. The breed of dog you have, as well as its level of fitness and age, will also determine how long and how vigorous your walk should be.</p> 

<p>We have professional pet walkers, both individuals and businesses who walk with your pets for their healthy  grooming. Some pet walkers will take many pets for a walk at once, while others will only take a single pet.The length of a walk might vary by breed or owners request ranging from short relief walks to longer walks with a specific amount of time set by the owner.</p>
 <p>A walk can make a dog very happy. They love to check out the sights and smells and will really look forward to spending time with you. A dog that doesn't receive sufficient exercise can easily become bored or destructive.Regular exercise with your pet is good for both your health and your dog's health and can be great fun. There's nothing like an exercise partner who's waiting by the door with a wagging tail to keep you motivated! </p>
