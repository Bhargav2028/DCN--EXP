        <p>“Pet sitting” is defined as “the act of caring for a pet in its own home while the owner is away.” Caring for pets in the clients’ homes is what separates pet sitters from boarders or doggie daycares.</p>
        <h2>Some advantages of pet sitting are:</h2>
        <ul><li>Pets are happier and experience less stress at home in their familiar environment.</li>
      
          <li> Diet and exercise routines are uninterrupted.</li>
      
          <li> Travel trauma for both owner and pet is eliminated.</li>
      
          <li> Pet's exposure to illness is minimized. </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>During the pet-sitting visits, pet sitters perform a variety of tasks, including:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li> Feeding the pets and changing their water bowls</li>
      
        <li> Providing exercise and play time (may include walking the dog)</li>
      
        <li> Cleaning litter boxes and cleaning up any other pet messes</li>
      
        <li> Administering pet medications, if needed</li>
