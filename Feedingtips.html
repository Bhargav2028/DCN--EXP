<h1>Dog Feeding</h1>

<p>Proteins are a source of energy
    Proteins are essential in helping the body defend itself against diseases
    Protein facilitates many processes that go on within the body such as digestion, metabolic reaction, etc.
    Protein is the building block that supports all the body tissues
    Protein is also responsible for keeping their immune system in check 
    Skin and coat maintenance can use up to 30-35% of dietary protein.</p> 

<pAmino acids, also known as the ‘building blocks of protein’ are essential for dogs. Dogs can synthesize 12 of the 22 different amino acids in their body. These are non-essential amino acids.

The remaining 10 amino acids – the essential, must be obtained through their diet. Hence, it is important that your pet’s diet contains all these 10 amino acids - arginine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan and valine as per your pet’s requirement.

If you choose dog food with high-quality protein, it will have all of the 10 essential amino acids.</p>
 <p>A walk can make a dog very happy. They love to check out the sights and smells and will really look forward to spending time with you. A dog that doesn't receive sufficient exercise can easily become bored or destructive.Regular exercise with your pet is good for both your health and your dog's health and can be great fun. There's nothing like an exercise partner who's waiting by the door with a wagging tail to keep you motivated! </p>
